    "* A force does work when it undergoes a displacement in the direction of its line of action\n",
    "* Consider $\\vec F$ that undergoes displacement $d\\vec r$, let $\\theta$ be the angle between the force and displacement, then the component of $\\vec F$ in the direction of displacement is $F \\cos \\theta$ , the work produced by $\\vec F$ is $dU = F dr \\cos \\theta$\n",
    "* We can simplify this by writing it in terms of dot product, $dU = \\vec F \\cdot d\\vec r$\n",
    "* Work is a scalar and can be positive or negative, the unit for work is joule ($N \\cdot m$)\n",
    "* Rotation of a couple moment is another way work is created\n",
    "* Consider a rigid body which is acted upon by couple forces $\\vec F$ and $-\\vec F$ which produce couple moment $\\vec M$, with magnitude $M = Fr$, If the body undergoes differential displacement then points $A$ and $B$ in the body move $d\\vec r_A$ and $d\\vec r_B$ to positions $A'$ and $B'$, since $d\\vec r_B = d\\vec r_1 + d\\vec r'$ is can be seen as a translation $d\\vec r_A$ where $A$ and $B$ move to $A'$ and $B\"$, then there is a rotation about $A'$ where the body rotates the angle $d\\theta$ about $A$, the couple forces do not work during the translation as each force undergo the same amount of displacement but in opposite directions, and cancelling out. When the body rotates $\\vec F$ is displaced $dr' = r d\\theta$ and it does work $dU = F dr' = Fr d\\theta$, since $M = Fr$ then $dU = M d\\theta$. When $\\vec M$ and $d\\theta$ have the same sense then work is positive, if they have opposite sense work is negative\n",

    "## Section 11.2 Principle of Virtual Work\n",
    "* Principle of work - states that if a body is in equilibrium then the sum of the virtual work done by all the forces and couple moments acting on the body is zero for any virtual displacements of the body, i.e. $\\delta U = 0$ &emsp; (11-3)\n",
    "* Consider a particle that is resting on a floor, let the ball be displaced down a virtual amount $\\delta y$, then the weight does positive virtual work $W \\delta y$ and the normal force does negative work $-N \\delta y$, since total virtual work must be zero, $\\delta U = W \\delta y -N \\delta y = (W-N) \\delta y = 0$, since $\\delta y \\neq 0$ then $N = W$ from $\\sum F_y = 0$\n",
    "* Virtual work equation $\\delta U = 0$ can be used on a rigid body subjected to a coplanar force system, in this system we can separate virtual transitions in the $x$ and $y$ directions, and a virtual rotation about an axis perpendicular to the $x$-$y$ plane that passes through arbitrary point $O$, will correspond to the equilibrium equations, when using these equations it is not needed to include work done by internal forces acting in the body since a rigid body does not deform when under an external load, when the body moves a virtual displacement the internal forces occur in equal but opposite collinear pairs so the work done by each pair will cancel\n",
    "* There is no advantage gained from solving equilibrium problems using the principle of virtual work, this is because for every application of the virtual work equation the virtual displacement factors out and the equation can be found just by applying the equation of equilibrium"
