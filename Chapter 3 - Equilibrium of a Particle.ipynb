    "* Equilibrium - a particle is in equilibrium if it stays at rest if originally at rest, or has a constant velocity if originally in motion\n",
    "* Maintaining Equilibrium - needs to satisfy Newton's first law of motion, $\\sum \\vec F = 0$, this is sufficient since $\\sum \\vec F = m \\vec a$, therefore $\\vec a = 0$, therefore constant velocity"

    "    * magnitude of force exerted on a linearly elastic spring can be expressed as $F = ks$, where $k$ is the stiffness, $s$ is the deformed distance, $s = l - l_0$, if $s$ is positive it is an elongation and $\\vec F$ must pull on the sting, if $s$ is negative it causes a shortening then $\\vec F$ must push on it.\n",

    "    * Cables will be assumed to have negligible weight and cannot stretch\n",
    "    * Cables can only support a tension force, and this force always acts in direction of the cable\n",
    "    * Tension force must have a constant magnitude to keep it in equilibrium when the cable is continuous, and it passes over a frictionless pulley\n",
    "* Smooth Contact\n",
    "    * When an object rests on a smooth surface, then the surface will exert a force on the object that is normal to the surface at the point of contact, denoted $\\vec N$"
