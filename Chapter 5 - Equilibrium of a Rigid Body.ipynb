    "* We can use the same methods from the last chapter to reduce the force and couple moment system to an equivalent resultant force and couple moment at any point $O$\n",
    "* Equilibrium - when both resultant force and couple moment are both equal to $0$ the body is equilibrium, $\\vec F_R = \\sum \\vec F = 0$ and $(\\vec M_R)_O = \\sum \\vec M_O = 0$\n",
    "* This is true since $\\sum \\vec M_A = \\vec r \\times \\vec F_R + (\\vec M_R)_O = 0$, and since $r \\neq 0 \\Rightarrow \\vec F_R = 0$ and $(\\vec M_R)_O = 0$\n",
    "* Applying these equations of equilibrium assume that the body remain rigid, this is because in the real world the bodies deform only slightly since steel and concrete is very rigid, this assumption allows the direction of the applied forces and their moment arms with respect to a fixed reference remain the same both before and after the load\n",
