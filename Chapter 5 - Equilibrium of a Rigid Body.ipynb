    "* We can use the same methods from the last chapter to reduce the force and couple moment system to an equivalent resultant force and couple moment at any point $O$\n",
    "* Equilibrium - when both resultant force and couple moment are both equal to $0$ the body is equilibrium, $\\vec F_R = \\sum \\vec F = 0$ and $(\\vec M_R)_O = \\sum \\vec M_O = 0$\n",
    "* This is true since $\\sum \\vec M_A = \\vec r \\times \\vec F_R + (\\vec M_R)_O = 0$, and since $r \\neq 0 \\Rightarrow \\vec F_R = 0$ and $(\\vec M_R)_O = 0$\n",
    "* Applying these equations of equilibrium assume that the body remain rigid, this is because in the real world the bodies deform only slightly since steel and concrete is very rigid, this assumption allows the direction of the applied forces and their moment arms with respect to a fixed reference remain the same both before and after the load\n",
    "* 2D - coplanar force system, rigid body lives inside a single plane, couple moments acting on the body are directed perpendicular to the plane,"

    "        * Pin - pin passes through a hole in the beam and two leaves which are fixed to the ground, the pin prevents translation of the beam in any direction $\\phi$ the pin exerts a force $\\vec F$ on the beam in the opposite direction, can represent $\\vec F$ in rectangular coordinates for simplification\n",
    "        * Fixed Support - prevents translation and rotation on the beam by creating a force and couple moment on the beam at its point of connection, can be represented in $\\vec F_x$ and $\\vec F_y$\n",
    "* Internal Forces that act between adjacent particles in a body occur in collinear pairs that have the same magnitude but act in opposite directions (Newton's Third Law)\n",
    "* There is no external effect on the body from internal forces, therefore internal forces are not included in free-body diagram\n",
    "* Weight - force resultant from the weight of every particle in the body, denoted $\\vec W$, location of its point of application is the center of gravity\n",
    "* If the body is uniform or made from the same material the center of gravity will be located at the geometric center of the body, if it not uniform the center of Gravity ($G$) will be given\n",
    "* If rotation is prevented then when the support is removed exerts a couple moment on the body"

Then apply moment equation of equilibrium about a point $O$ that lies at the intersection of the lines of action of two unknown forces, apply the force equilibrium equations and orient the $x$ and $y$ axes along lines that will provide the simplest resolution of the forces into their $x$ and $y$ components, finally if the solution of equilibrium is a negative scalar for a force or couple moment magnitude, then the sense is opposite to what was assumed"

Two-force member systems the two forces acting on the member must have same magnitude, but opposite direction, have the same line of action, directed along the line joining the two points where these forces act\n",
    "* Three-Force Members - member subjected to only three forces, moment equilibrium can be satisfied only if the three forces form a concurrent or parallel force system, if the lines of action of $\\vec F_1$ and $\\vec F_2$ intersect at point $O$ then the line of action of $\\vec F_3$ must also pass through point $O$ so that the forces satisfy $\\sum \\vec M_O = 0$, if the three forces are parallel, the location of the point of intersection $O$ will approach infinity."
