    "* In 2D - 3 internal loading resultants\n",
    "* In 3D - 1 general resultant internal force and 1 couple moment resultant\n",
    "* If $\\vec N_y$ is the normal force then $\\vec V_x$ and $\\vec V_z$ are shear force components, $\\vec M_y$ is torsional or twisting moment, $\\vec M_x$ and $\\vec M_y$ are bending moment components\n",

    "* If load on the beam suddenly changes then regions between each load must be selected to obtain each function of x\n",

    "* Create a FBD for a segment of the beam with length $\\Delta x$ is chosen at a point $x$ along the beam which is not subjected to a concentrated force or couple moment, these results will not apply at these points of concentrated loading, internal shear force and bending moment in FBD will be assumed to act in positive sense, shear force and moment acting on the right hand side must be increased by a small finite amount to keep segment in equilibrium, the distributed loading can be replaced by resultant force $\\Delta F = w(x) \\Delta x$ that acts at a fractional distance $k(\\Delta x)$ from the right end, $ 0 < k < 1$, if $w(x)$ is uniform $k = \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    "* Relation between the Distributed Load and Shear\n",
    "    * Use force equation of equilibrium - $\\sum F_y = 0 \\Rightarrow V + w(x) \\Delta x - (V + \\Delta V) = 0 \\Rightarrow \\Delta V = w(x) \\Delta x$, dividing by $\\Delta x$ and letting $\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0$, $\\frac{dV}{dx} = w(x)$, slope of shear diagram = distributed load intensity\n",
    "    * We can rewrite the equation and perform integration between two points on the beam, $\\Delta V = \\int{w(x)dx}$, change in shear = area under loading curve\n",
    "* Relation between the Shear and Moment\n",
    "    * Use moment equation of equilibrium about point $O$ on the FBD, $O$ is on the right edge of the segment in the middle, $\\sum M_O = 0 \\Rightarrow (M + \\Delta M) - (w(x) \\Delta x) k \\Delta x - V \\Delta x - M = 0 \\Rightarrow \\Delta M = V \\Delta x + kw(x) \\Delta x ^2$, dividing by $\\Delta x$ and let $\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0$, $\\frac{dM}{dx} = V$, slope of moment diagram = shear, maximum bending moment will happen where $\\frac{dM}{dx} = 0$ since this is where shear is $0$, can integrate this equation between two points on the beam, $\\Delta M = \\int{Vdx}$, change in moment = area under shear diagram\n",
    "      * The above equations do not apply at points where a concentrated force or couple moment acts, these create discontinuities in the shear and moment diagrams, each need separate treatment\n",
    "* Force - FBD of small segment of beam under one of the forces, force equilibrium requires $\\sum F_y = 0 \\Rightarrow \\Delta V = F$, change in shear is positive the shear diagram will go upward when $\\vec F$ acts upward on the beam, the jump in shear $\\Delta V$ is downward when $\\vec F$ acts downward\n",
    "* Couple Moment - remove a segment of the beam that is located at the couple moment $\\vec M_O$, let $\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0$, then $\\sum M = 0 \\Rightarrow \\Delta M = M_0$, change in moment is positive, moment diagram will go upward if $\\vec M_0$ is clockwise, jump $\\Delta M$ is downward when $\\vec M_O$ is counterclockwise\n",

    "## Section 7.4 Cables\n",
    "* Flexible cables combine strength with lightness and are used in structures for support and to transmit loads from one member to another\n",
    "* When cables are used to support suspension bridges and trolley wheels, the cables form the main load-carrying element of the structure\n",
    "* When doing force analysis of the system the weight of the cable can be neglected since it is small compared to the load\n",
    "* When cables are used as transmission lines the cable weigh may be needed for analysis\n",
    "* 3 cases will be considered in the analysis, in each case we will assume the cable is perfectly flexible and inextensible, due to flexibility the cable offers no resistance to bending, therefore the tensile force acting in the cable is tangent to the cable at points along its length, since it is inextensible the cable has a constant length before and after the load is applied, as a result once the load is applied the geometry of the cable is unchanged and the cable can be treated as a rigid body\n",
    "### Cable Subjected to Concentrated Loads\n",
    " * When a cable with negligible weight supports several concentrated loads, the cable takes form of several straight-line segments, each is subjected to a constant tensile force\n",
    " * Consider a cable with end points $A$ and $B$ with a point $C$ where a load, $\\vec P$ is applied, the sag $y_C$ is the distance between the y value of $A$ and the y value of $C$, $A$ has 2 components of reaction and $B$ has 2 components of reaction as well, each segment contains a tension force, total of 7 unknowns, to solve we can write 2 equations of equilibrium at each point, the last equation requires us to know something about the geometry of the cable, if we know the total length of cable we can use pythagorean theorem to relate each of the 2 segmental lengths, in terms of $h$ which is the y difference of $A$ and $B$, $y_C$ and $L_1$ and $L_2$ which are the lengths of the 2 segments, to the total length $L$. If $y_B$ is known the equilibrium equations are sufficient for obtaining the unknown forces, the length of the cable can be determined by trigonometry\n",
    "### Cable Subjected to a Distributed Load\n",
    "* Consider a weightless cable which is subjected to a distributed loading $w = w(x)$ that is measured in $x$ direction, the FBD of a small segment of the cable with length $\\Delta s$, the tensile force changes in magnitude and direction along the cable's length, we denote this change as $\\Delta T$ on the FBD, the distributed load is represented by its resultant force $w(x) \\Delta x$ which acts at a fractional distance $k(\\Delta x)$ from $O$, where $O$ is the right end point of the segment, $ 0<k<1$, apply equations fo equilibrium\n",

    "    * $T \\cos \\theta = constant = F_H$, $F_H$  &emsp; (7-10) is the horizontal component of tensile force at any point along the cable\n",
    "    * $T \\sin \\theta = \\int{w(x)dx}$  &emsp;  (7-11)\n",
    "* Dividing (7-11) by (7-10) eliminates $T$ then using (7-9) we can obtain the slope of the cable\n",
