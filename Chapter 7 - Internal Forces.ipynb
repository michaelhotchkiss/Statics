    "## Section 7.1 Internal Loadings Developed in Structural Members\n",
    "* Internal loadings can be determined using method of sections, need to know internal forces to know if the material can resist the loading\n",
    "* Force $\\vec N_B$ acts perpendicular to the cross-section, called normal force\n",
    "* Force $\\vec V_B$ acts tangent to the cross-section, called shear force\n",
    "* Couple moment $\\vec M_B$ is called bending moment\n",
    "* These force components prevent translation between the two segments, and couple moment prevents rotation\n",
    "* As a result of Newton's third law these loadings must act in opposite directions on each segment, can be determined by using equations of equilibrium\n",
    "* Direct solution for $\\vec N_B$, solve $\\sum F_x = 0$ where x is the axis in which only $\\vec N_B$ is on, to find $\\vec M_B$ apply $\\sum M_B = 0$ since moments of $\\vec N_B$ and $\\vec V_B$ about point $B$ i $0$, $B$ is the point of the cut\n",
    "* In 2D - 3 internal loading resultants\n",
    "* In 3D - 1 general resultant internal force and 1 couple moment resultant\n",
    "* If $\\vec N_y$ is the normal force then $\\vec V_x$ and $\\vec V_z$ are shear force components, $\\vec M_y$ is torsional or twisting moment, $\\vec M_x$ and $\\vec M_y$ are bending moment components\n",
    "* In most applications these resultant loadings act at the geometric center of the section's cross-sectional area\n",
    "* The magnitude for each loading can be different at various points along the axis of the member, we can use the method of sections to determine their values\n",
    "* The normal force is positive if it creates tension\n",
    "* Shear force is positive if it causes the beam segment to rotate clockwise\n",
    "* Bending moment is positive if it tends to bend the segment in a concave upward manner\n",
    "* 4 types of resultant internal loads in a member - normal and shear force, bending and torsional moments\n",
    "* Procedure for Analysis\n",
    "    * Determine support reactions\n",
    "    * FBD - keep all distributed loadings, couple moments, and forces acting on the member in the exact locations, then pass an imaginary section perpendicular to its axis at the point where the internal loadings will be determined\n",
    "    * FBD - draw FDB of the segment that has the least number of loads on it, indicate the components of the internal force and couple moment resultants at tge cross-section acting in their positive directions in accordance with the established sign convention\n",
    "    * Equations of Equilibrium - sum moments at the section, so normal and shear forces at the section are 0, therefore direct solution for moment\n",
    "    * Equations of Equilibrium - if the solution to the equations yields a negative scalar, the sense of the quantity is opposite to what is in the FBD"
