    "* If a distributed load acts perpendicular to an area and its intensity varies linearly, then to calculate the moment of the loading about an axis it will involve an integral, $\\int y^2dA$\n",
    "* Consider a plate submerged in a fluid and subjected to pressure $p$, since the pressure varies linearly with depth, $p = \\gamma y$ with $\\gamma$ being the specific weight of the fluid, therefore the force acting on the differential area $dA$ is $dF = p dA = (\\gamma y)dA$, the moment of this force about $x$ axis is $dM = y dF = \\gamma y^2 dA$, when we integrate this over the area of the plate we get $M = \\gamma \\int y^2dA$, the integral is referred to as the second moment of the area about an axis, or it is called the moment of inertia of the area.\n",
    "* Moments of inertia of differential area $dA$ about the $x$ and $y$ axes are $dI_x = y^2 dA$ and $dI_y = x^2 dA$, for the entire area $A$ the moments of inertia are $I_x = \\int_A y^2dA$ and $I_y = \\int_A x^2dA$ &emsp; (10-1)\n",

    "* Let disk element with radius $y$ and thickness $dz$ be chosen for integration, its volume is $dV = (\\pi y^2) dz$\n",
    "* The element is finite in the radial direction, and therefore its points do not all lie at the same radial distance $r$ from the $z$ axis, because of this (10-13) or (10-14) cannot be used. Instead, to integrate we have to determine the moment of inertia of the element about the $z$ axis and then integrate this result"
