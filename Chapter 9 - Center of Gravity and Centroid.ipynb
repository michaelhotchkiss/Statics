    "## Section 9.1 Center of Gravity, Center of Mass, and the Centroid of a Body\n",
    "* It is important to know the weight and its location when looking at the effect of the force on the body\n",
    "* Center of gravity, $\\vec G$ - point in which the resultant of a system,  total weight of body, passes through\n",
    "* $W = \\int dW$\n",
    "* Location of center of gravity, measured from $y$ axis $(M_R)_y = \\sum M_y \\Rightarrow \\bar x W = \\int x^\\sim  dW \\Rightarrow \\bar x = \\frac{\\int x dW}{\\int dW}$\n",
    "* 3D - $\\bar x = \\frac{\\int x dW}{\\int dW}$, $\\bar y = \\frac{\\int y dW}{\\int dW}$, $\\bar z = \\frac{\\int z dW}{\\int dW}$ &emsp; (9-1)\n",
    "* Where $\\bar x$, $\\bar y$, and $\\bar z$ are the coordinates of the center of gravity, and $x$,$y$, and $z$ are coordinates of an arbitrary point in the particle\n",
    "* The center of mass, $C_M$ is needed to study the dynamic response or accelerated motion of a boy\n",
    "* Location of center of mass can be found by substituting $dW = g dm$ into (9-1), if $g$ is constant it cancels out and becomes\n",
    "* $\\bar x = \\frac{\\int x dm}{\\int dm}$, $\\bar y = \\frac{\\int y dm}{\\int dm}$, $\\bar z = \\frac{\\int z dm}{\\int dm}$ &emsp; (9-2)\n",
    "* When a body is made of a homogenous material then its density is constant, therefore differential element of volume $dV$ has mass $dm = \\rho dV$, substitute this in (9-2) and canceling $\\rho$, we can locate centroid $C$ by $\\bar x = \\frac{\\int_V x dV}{\\int_V dV}$, $\\bar y = \\frac{\\int_V y dV}{\\int_V dV}$, $\\bar z = \\frac{\\int_V z dV}{\\int_V dV}$ &emsp; (9-3)\n",
    "* These equations represent a balance of the moments of the volume of the body, as a result if the volume has two planes of symmetry then its centroid must lie along the line of intersection of these two planes\n",
    "* When an area lies in $x$-$y$ plane and is bounded by $y = f(x)$ then its centroid will be in the plane and can be determined by $\\bar x = \\frac{\\int_A x dA}{\\int_A dA}$, $\\bar y = \\frac{\\int_A y dA}{\\int_A dA}$ &emsp; (9-4)\n",
    "* We can use single integration if we use a rectangular strip for the differential area element $dA$, example if we use a vertical strip the area is $dA = y dx$ and the centroid is at $x = x$ and $y = y/2$, we can consider the horizontal strip $dA = x dy$ and its centroid is located at $x=x/2$ and $y = y$\n",
    "* When a line segment (rod) lies in the $x$-$y$ plane and is described by $y = f(x)$ then its centroid is determined by $\\bar x = \\frac{\\int_L x dL}{\\int_L dL}$, $\\bar y = \\frac{\\int_L y dL}{\\int_L dL}$ &emsp; (9-5)\n",
    "* Length differential element is $dL = \\sqrt{(\\frac{dx}{dx})^2dx^2 + (\\frac{dy}{dx})^2dx^2} = \\sqrt{1 + (\\frac{dy}{dx})^2}dx$ or $dL = \\sqrt{(\\frac{dx}{dy})^2dy^2 + (\\frac{dy}{dy})^2dy^2} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2+1}dy$\n",
    "* Either can be used but one will be simpler to do depending on the problem\n",
    "* Centroid - geometric center of a body, coincides with center of mass or center of gravity if the material is uniform or homogenous\n",
    "* Centroid not always located on the body, like a ring, lie on any axis of symmetry for the body\n",
    "### Procedure for Analysis - center of gravity or centroid of an object can be determined by single integration by:\n",
    "* Select coordinate system, specify axes, and choose a differential element for integration\n",
    "* For lines the element is differential line segment with length $dL$\n",
    "* For areas the element is usually a rectangle with area $dA$ having finite length and differential width\n",
    "* For volumes the element can be a circular disk with volume $dV$, with finite radius and differential thickness\n",
    "* Locate the element so it touches an arbitrary point on the curve that defines the boundary of the shape\n",
    "* Express the differential element in terms of coordinates describing the curve\n",
    "* Express the moment arms $x$,$y$,$z$ for the centroid of the element in terms of the coordinates describing the curve\n",
    "* Substitute the formulations for $x$,$y$,$z$ and $dL$,$dA$, or $dV$ into the appropriate equations\n",
    "* Express the function in the integrand in terms of the same variable as the differential thickness of the element\n",
    "* The limits are defined from the two extreme locations of the element's differential thickness, so when integration is performed the entire region is covered"
